# Lab: EDA

## Introduction

ðŸ”‘ The key idea

- The superanimal model is a foundation model trained on tons of mouse videos.
- When you run it on your own video, DLC does three things:
  1. Inference before adaptation (apply the pretrained model as is).
  2. Adaptation (fine-tune the model a little bit on your own video, based on detected frames).
  3. Save both the predictions (CSV/JSON/MP4) and the adapted weights (H5/PT snapshots).

## Tasks

For this exercise you will first work on your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand what are the files you have at your disposition after running a pose estimation analysis. This is usually the first step that allow us to examine the data, its characteristics and possible anomalies before actually working with the prediction files.
