    "1. Read carefully each section before running the cells.\n",
    "2.\tWhen a cell requires you to code, you‚Äôll see a TODO comment.\n",
    "3.\tThe TODO will tell you how many lines of code you are expected to write.\n",

    "In this notebook, you will analyze pose-estimation data from a freely-moving mouse. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will follow **Pixel** üê≠üíõ, a little mouse exploring an arena.\n",
    "Using pose data captured by SuperAnimal, we‚Äôll uncover how Pixel moves, rests, and explores. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to transform raw x,y coordinates into quantitative descriptions of movement and space use, similar to what behavioral neuroscientists do when studying exploration and locomotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise you will have access to the data in form of a .h5 file that has been already pre-processed as in the previous notebook. \n",
