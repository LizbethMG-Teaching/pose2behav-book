    "# 📓 Notebook 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Pose Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction & objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore pose estimation outputs generated with SuperAnimal ModelZoo on 10-minute top-view mouse videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning goals:**\n",
    "- Understand the structure of .h5 output files\n",
    "- Explore metadata and summary statistics\n",
    "- Visualize likelihoods, trajectories, and skeletons\n",
    "- Detect and correct errors (missing points, jumps)\n",
    "- Compare outputs from clear vs challenging videos\n",
    "- Prepare cleaned data for further analysis\n",

    "**Narrative**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a junior researcher in a neuroscience lab. Your colleague just handed you pose estimation outputs generated with SuperAnimal ModelZoo from 10-minute videos of mice exploring an arena. Before you can ask scientific questions about locomotion, posture, or social behavior, you need to verify the quality of these model predictions. Are all the keypoints tracked reliably? Do some body parts drop out in certain conditions? How does tracking quality differ between a clear video and a more challenging one?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will take the role of a data detective: opening the .h5 pose files, exploring the structure, visualizing likelihoods and trajectories, spotting errors, and applying simple corrections. By the end, you will produce a short “quality report” that prepares you for deeper behavioral analysis in the next notebooks.\n"
