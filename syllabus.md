## Course overview 

This course introduces students to quantitative, data-driven methods for analyzing animal behavior from video recordings. Using deep-learning based pose estimation tools such as *DeepLabCut*, participants learn how to extract movement keypoints and transform them into interpretable behavioral metrics. The course combines lectures on the theoretical foundations of computational behavioral analysis with hands-on exercises that guide students through the full workflow: from video ‚Üí pose data ‚Üí behavioral quantification ‚Üí visualization and interpretation.

## In practice

This course combines theoretical sessions (short presentations, sometimes followed by quizzes) with hands-on laboratory exercises (‚ÄúLabs‚Äù) for each major theme.
The labs are designed to help you apply theoretical concepts to real-world data and examples in animal pose estimation and behavioral analysis.

Throughout the course, you will find:

- Conceptual questions that help you consolidate what was covered during the lectures.
- Practical exercises in Jupyter Notebooks where you will manipulate real data.
- Challenging reflection questions, which encourage deeper thinking and may or may not appear in the quizzes.

You have access to this **Book**, which contains:

- Introductory information and guidance for each Lab.
- Direct links to the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks where you will perform the exercises.

Depending on your specific program or module, you may be required to complete all labs or only a subset of them.

## What Are the Labs?

The Labs form the practical component of this course.
Each lab focuses on a key topic related to animal pose estimation and behavioral analysis using AI-based tools such as DeepLabCut.

## üéØCourse learning outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Explain the principles of pose estimation.
* Preprocess and clean pose data generated from videos.
* Compute basic behavioral metrics such as trajectories, speed, and spatial occupancy.
* Visualize and interpret behavioral data to generate clear scientific insights.
* Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of AI-driven pose estimation analysis approaches.
